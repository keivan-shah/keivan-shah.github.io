      <description>Introduction Creating and hosting a website is something that many of us wondered if not tried to do. While hosting a dynamic website is comparatively challenging, its quite easy to host a simple static website with something like Github Pages. So in this post I try to help people setup up what could potentially be your first website :D
Note: Being a developer I just assume that people know the basics of computer programming and can get by with using a little bit of commandline.</description>
