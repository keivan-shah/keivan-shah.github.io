      <description>Introduction Today I came a new term: L-System and I found it quite fascinating. The idea that simple rules can lead to formation of complex structures which might be used to model tree and organism growth and also generate fractals.
From what I understood the Grammar or rules that define the L-System are very simple. It it kindof like formal grammar that people study in Theory Of Computation or similar courses taught in Computer Science.</description>

      <description>Introduction Creating and hosting a website is something that many of us wondered if not tried to do. While hosting a dynamic website is comparatively challenging, its quite easy to host a simple static website with something like Github Pages. So in this post I try to help people setup up what could potentially be your first website :D
Note: Being a developer I just assume that people know the basics of computer programming and can get by with using a little bit of commandline.</description>
