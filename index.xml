The grid shows the number of commits and other interactions that the user performed on each day over the last year.
Since I have started working professionally and I use a different Github account for it, the contribution graph on my personal Github account has been quite empty lately.</description></item><item><title>L-System</title><link>/posts/lsystem/random_lsystem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/lsystem/random_lsystem/</guid><description>Introduction Today I came across a new term: L-System and I found it quite fascinating. The idea that simple rules can lead to the formation of complex structures that might be used to model tree and organism growth and also generate fractals is intriguing to me.
This image was created with help of L-System and it&amp;rsquo;s visualization. It can also be used to model far more complicated tree structures. If you are interested you can checkout how I created this image here and the code for the same can be found here.</description></item><item><title>Creating your Static Website</title><link>/posts/creating-a-new-website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/creating-a-new-website/</guid><description>Introduction Creating and hosting a website is something that many of us wondered if not tried to do. While hosting a dynamic website is comparatively challenging, it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to host a simple static website with something like Github Pages. So in this post, I try to help people setup up what could potentially be your first website :D
Note: Being a developer I just assume that people know the basics of computer programming and can get by with using a little bit of command-line.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Hey, Keivan Shah here.
