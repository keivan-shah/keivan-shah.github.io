The grid shows the number of commits and other interactions that the user performed on each day over the last year.</p><p>Since I have started working professionally and I use a different Github account for it, the contribution graph on my personal Github account has been quite empty lately. Here&rsquo;s a look at my contribution graph before I decided to draw my name all over it :P</p><p><a href=https://github.com/keivan-shah><img src=/img/orig_contri_graph.png alt="Github Contri Graph" class=center style=border-radius:8px></a></p><p>While I do intend to change the near empty commit history and start making more open-source contributions as well as work more on personal projects on my Github, I wanted to see if I could maybe hack the graph to display something interesting in the meantime?</p><p>While some might question if this is ethical to do, here&rsquo;s my take on it:</p><ul><li>The commit graph is a <strong>not</strong> an indicator of a profile&rsquo;s importance, it does not showcase commits one makes to their private repositories or to another source control systems. While some companies do review people&rsquo;s Github commit history as a selection criteria, I do not support that metric as a good idea. Looking at the profile commit history and projects contributed to is much more important in my opinion. Also the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the contribution graph was that it is an awesome open pixel canvas and it would be so cool to draw a pixel diagram here, keeping that in mind, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unethical and hence going ahead with anyways.</li></ul><h2 id=execution>Execution</h2><p>So having worked with git and Github before, I already had an rough idea that Github allows you to import old repos to their platform, so I was pretty sure that they must allow you to fake the dates on a commit somehow and probably that showed up on the contribution graph as well. Turns out that faking the date is very simple, you just need to set the <code>GIT_AUTHOR_DATE</code> and <code>GIT_COMMITTER_DATE</code> environment variables. So doing this seems to be quite easy, I was all set to writeup my own script to do this. But just a quick web search before that made me aware of many projects already existing that do this.</p><p>The one I found to be most polished was <a href=https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti>gitfiti</a>. This project allows you to interactively create a bash script that you can run manually and create the contribution graph. This is exactly what I wanted, just a few minor things that were missing were an ability to continously loop the design and include commits into the future so that I can run this once and be rest assured that my grafiti will be there for years to come without any need for my intervention!</p><p>You can find the code I wrote for this <a href=https://github.com/keivan-shah/gitfiti/tree/keivan_repeat>here</a>. And to see the commits that I made using the script, look at <a href=https://github.com/keivan-shah/githubProfileArt>this repo</a>. With the commits made till the year 2037, repeating &ldquo;Keivan&rdquo; 50 times across the grid, I think I am free from the curse of empty contribution graphs for quite a few years for now :P</p><h2 id=result>Result</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/keivan-shah><img src=/img/final_contri_graph.png alt="Github Contri Graph" class=center style=border-radius:8px></a></p><p>Overall the graph does look nice and much better than having a blank diagram. I do have a few ideas to improve upon this further, but maybe next time?</p><h2 id=future-ideas>Future Ideas</h2><ul><li>Come up with something more creative than just drawing my name over the grid?</li><li>Instead of hacking this to make all the commits at once, can we make use of scheduled Github Actions to carry out a few commits on my behalf and populate the graph?</li></ul><h2 id=acknowledgments>Acknowledgments</h2><ul><li>Inspired by <a href=https://github.com/will>@will</a> and this <a href=https://bd808.com/blog/2013/04/17/hacking-github-contributions-calendar/>blog</a></li><li>Thanks to <a href=https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti>gitfiti</a></li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>
